# Foundry Testing MCP – Executive Deck (Condensed)


## Slide 1  Why This Matters

| Current Pain | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Testing often lags behind code creation; audits find bugs late in the development cycle | Can lead to launch delays and cost overruns |
| AI-generated tests are changing the pace of test creation, but they can mask gaps (circular logic, trivial mocks) | False sense of security |
| Requires additional, dedicated effort to wire Foundry tooling into CI / AI flows | Lost product engineering time |

**Foundry Testing MCP** automates test analysis and generation so teams ship faster with less risk.

## Slide 2  What the MCP Does

1. **Scans** contracts & existing tests – no code leaves the laptop.  
2. **Detects** eight common AI-failure patterns early.  
3. **Plans** multi-phase workflows (unit, integration, fuzz, invariant, security).  
4. **Generates** Repo-specific solidity tests from reusable, flexible templates.  
5. **Runs & parses** `forge test / coverage / gas` for real metrics.

Outcome: repeatable process → measurable quality → audit-ready code.

## Slide 3  Architecture at a Glance

```text
AI Client (Cursor / Claude)  →  MCP Server (Python)  →  Foundry CLI
     Developer Interface        Analysis / Workflows    forge / cast / anvil
```
* Regex-first analysis works everywhere. AST enhancement kicks in if `solc` is available.  
* Host locally for private MCP or deploy for broader access.

## Slide 4  Key Capabilities

| Area | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Analysis** | Contract type detection (DeFi, NFT, Governance, etc.), maturity scoring, coverage snapshot |
| **AI-Failure Guardrails** | Circular logic, mock cheating, missing edge cases, 5 others |
| **Workflow Engine** | Create-new-suite / expand-coverage / security-focused – each with phase tracking |
| **Templates** | Unit, integration, invariant, security, helper – build to AI coding with placeholder substitution |
| **Reporting** | JSON output for CI dashboards; coverage %, risk scores, progress metrics |

## Slide 5  Value to the Organisation

• **Faster Releases** – Boilerplate tests for any protocol generated in quickly; an advanced starting point.
• **Audit Cost Savings** – Issues caught internally before paying auditors.  
• **Developer Productivity** – Engineers focus on logic, not scaffolding.

## Slide 6  Adoption – Day 1 to Week 4

| Time | Activity | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| Step 1 | Clone repo, run server, baseline scan | Clear picture of gaps |
| Step 2 | Execute `initialize_protocol_testing_agent` workflow | Repo-specfic analysis and planning
| Step 3 | Create unit, integration & security tests | Iterate for coverage → 70-80 % |
| Step 4 | Add invariant & fuzz tests | Coverage → 90 %+ |
| Step 5 | Final review, AI failure detection cycle, clean-up and documentation

## Slide 7  Risks & Mitigations *** REDO this section

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Foundry not installed in CI | Validation tool checks, clear install script |
| Directory mis-alignment between client & server | `debug_directory_detection` tool + env vars |
| Large codebases slow regex scan | Linear-time algorithm; initial scan <15 s for 1k files |
| AST features unavailable | Falls back to regex-only; core value intact |

## Slide 8  Roadmap & Call to Action

Next 6 months: Create stable prototype, host, expand test group. 

**Ask:**  
• Pilot on several internal smart contract projects in development. 
• Expand to several contributing engineers.
• Review, iterate, improve -- reduce code and refine workflows. 
• Seek review from professional auditors for additional insight.
