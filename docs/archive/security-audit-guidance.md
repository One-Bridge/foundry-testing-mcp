### **Guiding Principles for the AI Agent**

1.  **Foundry-First**: All generated tests must be idiomatic to the Foundry framework. Prioritize the use of cheatcodes (`vm`), test contracts (`Test`), and standard project structure (`test/`, `script/`, `src/`).
2.  **Practicality Over Theory**: This framework intentionally omits formal verification in favor of practical, high-impact testing techniques available in Foundry. **Invariant testing is the primary method for verifying system properties.**
3.  **Separation of Concerns**: Generate distinct test files for different testing purposes to enhance clarity and maintainability. A standard suite should include:
      * `Contract.t.sol`: Core unit/integration tests.
      * `ContractSecurity.t.sol`: Focused tests for specific vulnerabilities.
      * `ContractInvariant.t.sol`: Stateful fuzzing to test system invariants.
      * `ContractUpgrade.t.sol`: Tests for proxy upgradeability (if applicable).
4.  **Test Against the Specification**: Tests should validate the intended behavior (the "what") rather than mirroring the implementation (the "how").

### **Test Generation Workflow**

**Phase 1: Threat Modeling**

  * Identify core assets, privileged roles, and trust boundaries.
  * Map all external and user-facing functions as potential attack surfaces.
  * Analyze economic incentives, potential for value extraction, and griefing vectors.
  * Document all security assumptions (e.g., "the USDC contract is trusted," "oracles are reliable within a 5% deviation").

**Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis**

  * Systematically review for common vulnerability patterns (see list below).
  * Use static analysis to identify potential low-hanging fruit.
  * **Define Critical Invariants**: Identify properties of the system that must always hold true (e.g., `totalSupply` == sum of balances, contract balance \>= required reserves).

**Phase 3: Security Test Implementation**

  * Generate a comprehensive test suite covering all identified threats and attack vectors.
  * **Implement Invariant Tests**: Create a `Handler` contract for stateful fuzzing to verify the critical invariants defined in Phase 2.
  * **Implement Fork Tests**: For contracts interacting with existing mainnet protocols, generate tests that run on a mainnet fork to validate real-world integrations.
  * Implement negative tests for every `require` statement and potential revert condition.

**Phase 4: Validation and Documentation**

  * Add NatSpec comments to all generated test functions explaining the **scenario**, **action**, and **expected outcome**.
  * Ensure generated tests are clean, readable, and maintainable by human developers and auditors.

### **Common AI-Generated Testing Failures**

  * **Circular Logic Testing**: The test re-implements the contract's logic instead of asserting a specific outcome. **Fix**: Test for the *effect* of a function call, not the steps it takes.
  * **Overuse of `deal` or `etch`**: Setting up state with cheatcodes bypasses contract logic. **Fix**: For integration tests, set up state by calling the contract's own functions (e.g., `deposit()` then `rebalance()` to get shares). Use `deal` only for tightly-scoped unit tests.
  * **Insufficient Edge Case Coverage**: Tests only cover the "happy path." **Fix**: Systematically test for boundary conditions (0, 1, `type(uint256).max`), empty arrays, zero addresses, and error states.
  * **Missing Security Scenarios**: The suite lacks tests for common attack vectors. **Fix**: Explicitly generate tests for reentrancy, access control, and relevant economic attacks.
  * **Inadequate Randomization in Fuzz Tests**: Fuzz test inputs are drawn from a narrow or predictable range. **Fix**: Use Foundry's `bound` function or custom modifiers to ensure fuzz inputs cover a wide and meaningful spectrum of values.

### **Foundry-Native Security Test Patterns**

#### **Unit Testing for Security**

**Access Control Testing**

```solidity
function test_updateConfig_fails_whenCalledByNonOwner() public {
    vm.expectRevert("Ownable: caller is not the owner");
    vm.prank(unauthorizedUser);
    portfolio.updateConfig(newConfig);
}
```

**Input Validation Testing**

```solidity
function test_deposit_fails_withZeroAmount() public {
    vm.expectRevert(Portfolio.InsufficientBalance.selector);
    portfolio.deposit(0);
}
```

#### **Integration Testing: Reentrancy**

A proper reentrancy test requires a malicious contract mock.

```solidity
// In the test file (e.g., PortfolioSecurityTest.t.sol)
contract MaliciousReentrant {
    Portfolio portfolio;
    // Malicious call data to re-enter
    bytes callData = abi.encodeWithSelector(Portfolio.deposit.selector, 1 ether);

    constructor(Portfolio _portfolio) { portfolio = _portfolio; }

    // This function receives ETH/tokens and re-enters the target
    receive() external payable {
        // Attempt re-entrancy
        (bool success,) = address(portfolio).call(callData);
        // This call should fail if the contract is protected
        require(success, "Re-entrant call succeeded unexpectedly");
    }

    function attack() external {
        // This external call will trigger the receive() fallback
        portfolio.withdrawAndSendTo(address(this));
    }
}

// The test function
function testFail_reentrancyOnWithdraw() public {
    MaliciousReentrant attacker = new MaliciousReentrant(portfolio);
    // Setup: user deposits, etc.

    vm.prank(userWithFunds);
    // The call to `attack()` should revert because the re-entrant
    // call inside `receive()` will be blocked by the reentrancy guard.
    vm.expectRevert("ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    attacker.attack();
}
```

#### **Stateful Fuzzing (Invariant Testing) Pattern**

This pattern uses a `handler` contract to perform random actions, while the main test contract verifies invariants.

```solidity
// In the test file (e.g., PortfolioInvariantTest.t.sol)
import {StdInvariant} from "forge-std/StdInvariant.sol";

// Handler contract to perform random actions
contract Handler is Test {
    Portfolio portfolio;
    constructor(Portfolio _portfolio) { portfolio = _portfolio; }

    function deposit(uint256 amount) public {
        amount = bound(amount, 1, 100_000e18);
        // ... (logic to get funds and approve)
        try portfolio.deposit(amount) {} catch {}
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 shares) public {
        // ... (logic to bound shares based on user balance)
        try portfolio.withdraw(shares) {} catch {}
    }
}

// The invariant test contract
contract InvariantTest is StdInvariant, Test {
    Portfolio portfolio;
    Handler handler;

    function setUp() public {
        portfolio = new Portfolio();
        handler = new Handler(portfolio);
        // Target the handler contract for fuzzing
        targetContract(address(handler));
    }

    // This invariant will be checked after every call made by the fuzzer
    function invariant_usdcHoldingTankEqualsTotalPendingDeposits() public view {
        assertEq(
            portfolio.usdcHoldingTank(),
            portfolio.totalPendingUSDCDeposits()
        );
    }
}
```

#### **Fork Testing Pattern**

This tests interactions with live mainnet contracts.

```solidity
// To run: forge test --fork-url <your_rpc_url>
contract ForkTest is Test {
    // Mainnet address of Uniswap V3 Router
    IUniswapV3Router constant UNISWAP_ROUTER = IUniswapV3Router(0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564);
    IERC20 constant WETH = IERC20(0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2);
    IERC20 constant DAI = IERC20(0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F);

    function test_swapOnUniswap() public {
        uint256 amountIn = 10 ether;
        // Get WETH for this test contract using a cheatcode
        deal(address(WETH), address(this), amountIn);

        WETH.approve(address(UNISWAP_ROUTER), amountIn);

        // Define swap params...
        // ...

        uint256 initialDaiBalance = DAI.balanceOf(address(this));
        UNISWAP_ROUTER.exactInputSingle(params);
        uint256 finalDaiBalance = DAI.balanceOf(address(this));

        // Assert that we received some DAI from the swap
        assertTrue(finalDaiBalance > initialDaiBalance);
    }
}
```
