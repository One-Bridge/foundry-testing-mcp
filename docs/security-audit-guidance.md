## Core Security Audit Methodology

### Security Testing Framework

**Phase 1: Threat Modeling**

- Map attack surfaces and entry points
- Analyze economic incentives and potential exploits
- Document security assumptions and requirements

**Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis**
- Systematic review of common vulnerability patterns
- Static analysis of contract code and dependencies
- Dynamic testing of edge cases and attack scenarios
- Formal verification of critical properties

**Phase 3: Security Testing Implementation**
- Comprehensive test suite covering identified threats
- Automated testing for regression prevention
- Integration testing for cross-contract interactions
- Performance testing under adversarial conditions

**Phase 4: Validation and Documentation**
- Verification of security controls effectiveness
- Documentation of security testing rationale
- Audit trail for security decisions
- Maintenance procedures for ongoing security

### Access Control Security Framework

Based on Trail of Bits access control maturity model:

**Level 1: Single EOA Control**
- Single externally owned account controls all functions
- Testing Requirements: Verify owner-only functions, test ownership transfer
- Common Issues: Single point of failure, key compromise risk

**Level 2: Multi-Signature Control**
- Multiple signatures required for critical operations
- Testing Requirements: Validate signature thresholds, test key rotation
- Common Issues: Signature replay, threshold manipulation

**Level 3: Role-Based Access Control**
- Different roles with specific permissions
- Testing Requirements: Test role assignment, verify permission boundaries
- Common Issues: Role escalation, permission overlap

**Level 4: Immutable or Governance-Based**
- Immutable contracts or decentralized governance
- Testing Requirements: Verify immutability, test governance mechanisms
- Common Issues: Governance attacks, emergency function abuse

## AI Coding Agent Failure Patterns

### Common AI-Generated Testing Failures

**Circular Logic Testing**
- **Pattern**: Tests that validate contract behavior against the contract's own implementation
- **Detection**: Test logic mirrors implementation logic exactly
- **Fix**: Test against specifications, not implementation

**Mock Inconsistency**
- **Pattern**: Test mocks that always return expected values
- **Detection**: Mocks never fail or return unexpected results
- **Fix**: Implement realistic mock behaviors including failure scenarios

**Insufficient Edge Case Coverage**
- **Pattern**: Tests only cover happy path scenarios
- **Detection**: No tests for boundary conditions or error states
- **Fix**: Systematic edge case identification and testing

**Missing Security Scenarios**
- **Pattern**: No tests for common attack vectors
- **Detection**: Absence of reentrancy, overflow, or access control tests
- **Fix**: Comprehensive security test suite based on vulnerability patterns

**Always-Passing Tests**
- **Pattern**: Tests that cannot fail due to logical errors
- **Detection**: Tests with trivial assertions or no failure conditions
- **Fix**: Meaningful assertions that can legitimately fail

**Inadequate Randomization**
- **Pattern**: Fuzz tests with insufficient randomness
- **Detection**: Limited input ranges or predictable test data
- **Fix**: Comprehensive input space exploration with proper randomization

**Missing Negative Tests**
- **Pattern**: No tests for expected failures
- **Detection**: No tests using expectRevert or similar failure verification
- **Fix**: Comprehensive negative testing for all error conditions

**Implementation Dependency**
- **Pattern**: Tests tied to specific implementation details
- **Detection**: Tests break when implementation changes without specification change
- **Fix**: Interface-based testing against stable specifications

## Security Vulnerability Patterns

### Access Control Vulnerabilities

**Unauthorized Access**
- **Pattern**: Functions callable by unintended parties
- **Testing**: Verify access controls for all privileged functions
- **Example**: Test that non-owner cannot call admin functions

**Privilege Escalation**
- **Pattern**: Users gaining higher permissions than intended
- **Testing**: Verify role boundaries and permission inheritance
- **Example**: Test that user roles cannot be elevated without authorization

**Missing Access Controls**
- **Pattern**: Critical functions without proper access restrictions
- **Testing**: Verify all state-changing functions have appropriate controls
- **Example**: Test that critical configuration changes require proper authorization

### Reentrancy Vulnerabilities

**Single-Function Reentrancy**
- **Pattern**: Recursive calls to the same function
- **Testing**: Verify reentrancy protection mechanisms
- **Example**: Test that withdrawal functions cannot be called recursively

**Cross-Function Reentrancy**
- **Pattern**: Reentrancy between different functions
- **Testing**: Verify state consistency across function calls
- **Example**: Test that balance updates are atomic across related functions

**Cross-Contract Reentrancy**
- **Pattern**: Reentrancy through external contract calls
- **Testing**: Verify protection against external contract callbacks
- **Example**: Test that external calls cannot manipulate internal state

### Economic Attack Vectors

**Flash Loan Attacks**
- **Pattern**: Manipulation of protocol state using borrowed funds
- **Testing**: Verify protocol behavior under extreme liquidity conditions
- **Example**: Test that price calculations remain accurate during flash loan operations

**Oracle Manipulation**
- **Pattern**: Manipulation of external price feeds
- **Testing**: Verify oracle data validation and circuit breakers
- **Example**: Test that large price movements are handled appropriately

**Front-Running Attacks**
- **Pattern**: Exploitation of transaction ordering
- **Testing**: Verify commit-reveal schemes and other front-running protections
- **Example**: Test that sensitive operations are protected from MEV exploitation

## Security Testing Patterns

### Unit Testing for Security

**Access Control Testing**
```solidity
function testOnlyOwnerCanUpdateConfig() public {
    vm.expectRevert("Ownable: caller is not the owner");
    vm.prank(user);
    contract.updateConfig(newConfig);
}
```

**Reentrancy Testing**
```solidity
function testReentrancyProtection() public {
    vm.expectRevert("ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    contract.vulnerableFunction();
}
```

**Input Validation Testing**
```solidity
function testInputValidation() public {
    vm.expectRevert("Invalid input");
    contract.processInput(invalidInput);
}
```

### Integration Testing for Security

**Cross-Contract Security**
```solidity
function testCrossContractSecurity() public {
    // Test that external contract interactions are secure
    // Verify that callbacks cannot manipulate state
    // Test that external contract failures are handled properly
}
```

**Economic Model Testing**
```solidity
function testEconomicIncentives() public {
    // Test that economic incentives align with protocol goals
    // Verify that attacks are not profitable
    // Test that honest behavior is rewarded
}
```

### Invariant Testing for Security

**System Invariants**
```solidity
function invariant_totalSupplyConsistency() public {
    // Total supply should equal sum of all balances
    assertEq(token.totalSupply(), sumOfAllBalances());
}
```

**Security Invariants**
```solidity
function invariant_accessControlConsistency() public {
    // Only authorized users should have admin rights
    assertTrue(onlyAuthorizedUsersHaveAdminRights());
}
```
