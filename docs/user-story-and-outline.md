# User Story and Outline - Building Robust Testing Suites with Foundry Testing MCP

## Overview

This document walks through the practical process of using the Foundry Testing MCP to build comprehensive testing suites for Solidity protocols. It covers two main scenarios: starting from scratch with raw contracts that have no tests, and improving existing projects that already have some testing but need enhancement for production deployment.

The goal is to help developers systematically build testing infrastructure that provides confidence in their smart contracts through proper coverage, security testing, and quality assurance.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

### Required Setup
- **Foundry installed**: `forge --version` should work
- **Valid Foundry project**: foundry.toml exists in your project root
- **MCP client configured**: Cursor, Claude Desktop, or compatible MCP client
- **Project structure**: Contracts in `src/` directory following Foundry conventions

### Project Examples
This guide assumes you're working with one of these project types:
- **DeFi Protocol**: Token contracts, liquidity pools, staking mechanisms
- **NFT Project**: ERC721/ERC1155 contracts with minting and marketplace features  
- **DAO Contract**: Governance contracts with voting and proposal mechanisms
- **General Protocol**: Any smart contract system requiring comprehensive testing

## Scenario 1: Starting from Scratch (No Existing Tests)

### Initial State
You have Solidity contracts in your `src/` directory but no testing infrastructure. Your project structure looks like:

```
my-protocol/
├── foundry.toml
├── src/
│   ├── MyToken.sol
│   ├── MyVault.sol
│   └── MyGovernance.sol
└── test/     # Empty or doesn't exist
```

### Step 1: Project Analysis and Planning

**Action**: Start with the initialization tool to understand your current state.

**MCP Tool Call**:
```
initialize_protocol_testing_agent(
    analysis_mode="interactive"
)
```

**What This Does**:
- Scans your `src/` directory to identify contracts
- Determines project complexity (number of contracts, inheritance patterns)
- Detects contract types (tokens, governance, access control patterns)
- Recommends appropriate testing approach based on your specific contracts

**Expected Output**:
- Project analysis showing "None" testing phase (no existing tests)
- Workflow recommendation for "create_foundational_suite"
- Contract-specific insights (e.g., "Detected ERC20 token with admin functions")
- Session ID for continuing the workflow

**What You Learn**:
- Which contracts are most complex and need priority testing
- Estimated timeline for comprehensive testing
- Specific security concerns based on your contract patterns

### Step 2: Create Testing Infrastructure

**Action**: Execute the foundational testing workflow.

**MCP Tool Call**:
```
execute_testing_workflow(
    workflow_type="create_foundational_suite",
    objectives="Create comprehensive test suite for production deployment",
    scope="comprehensive",
    session_id="<from_step_1>"
)
```

**What This Does**:
- Creates a structured 3-4 phase implementation plan
- Provides specific guidance for your contract types
- Generates file structure recommendations
- Offers template suggestions based on your contracts

**Phase-by-Phase Implementation**:

**Phase 1: Basic Test Infrastructure **
- Create `test/` directory structure
- Set up base test contracts
- Implement basic unit tests for core functions
- Establish testing patterns and conventions

**Phase 2: Core Functionality Testing **
- Comprehensive unit tests for all public functions
- Happy path testing for main contract workflows
- Basic edge case testing (zero values, boundary conditions)
- Mock implementations for external dependencies

**Phase 3: Integration and Security Testing **
- Multi-contract interaction tests
- Access control testing (admin functions, role-based permissions)
- Security scenario testing (reentrancy, overflow/underflow protection)
- Gas optimization validation

**Phase 4: Advanced Testing and Quality Assurance **
- Invariant testing for system properties
- Fuzz testing for edge case discovery
- Integration with external protocols (if applicable)
- Performance and gas cost optimization

### Step 3: Implement Helper Utilities

**Action**: Create shared testing utilities to reduce code duplication.

**MCP Resource Access**:
```
Access: testing://templates/helper
```

**Implementation**:
1. Create `test/utils/TestHelper.sol` using the helper template
2. Customize placeholders for your specific contracts
3. Include common functions like:
   - Account setup and funding
   - Token distribution for testing
   - Time manipulation for time-dependent tests
   - Common assertion patterns

**Benefits**:
- Consistent testing patterns across all test files
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Standardized test data generation

### Step 4: Template-Based Test Creation

**Action**: Use templates to create structured tests for each contract type.

**Available Templates**:

**Unit Tests** (`testing://templates/unit`):
```solidity
// Example for MyToken.sol
contract MyTokenTest is Test, TestHelper {
    MyToken public token;
    
    function setUp() public {
        setupAccounts();  // From TestHelper
        token = new MyToken();
    }
    
    function test_transfer_whenValidAmount_shouldTransferTokens() public {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

**Integration Tests** (`testing://templates/integration`):
```solidity
// Example for MyVault + MyToken interaction
contract VaultIntegrationTest is Test, TestHelper {
    MyToken public token;
    MyVault public vault;
    
    function test_deposit_workflow() public {
        // Multi-contract interaction testing
    }
}
```

**Security Tests** (`testing://templates/security`):
```solidity
// Example for access control testing
contract MyTokenSecurityTest is Test, TestHelper {
    function test_onlyOwner_functions_revertForNonOwner() public {
        // Access control validation
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Monitor Progress and Quality

**Action**: Regularly check coverage and identify gaps.

**MCP Tool Call**:
```
analyze_current_test_coverage(
    target_coverage=90,
    include_branches=true
)
```

**What This Provides**:
- Current coverage percentages (line, branch, function)
- Specific uncovered code sections
- Recommendations for reaching target coverage
- Quality assessment of existing tests

**Iteration Process**:
1. Run coverage analysis
2. Identify gaps in coverage
3. Add tests for uncovered areas
4. Repeat until target coverage achieved

### Step 6: Quality Assurance

**Action**: Ensure test quality and effectiveness.

**MCP Tool Call**:
```
analyze_project_context(
    include_ai_failure_detection=true,
    generate_improvement_plan=true
)
```

**What This Catches**:
- Tests that always pass (no real validation)
- Mock objects that don't represent real behavior
- Missing edge cases and error scenarios
- Circular logic in test validation

## Scenario 2: Improving Existing Tests (Mature Projects)

### Initial State
You have an existing project with some tests but need improvement for production deployment:

```
mature-protocol/
├── foundry.toml
├── src/
│   ├── ComplexProtocol.sol
│   ├── TokenManager.sol
│   └── GovernanceModule.sol
└── test/
    ├── BasicProtocolTest.sol     # 15 tests, basic functionality
    ├── TokenTest.sol             # 8 tests, happy path only
    └── mocks/
        └── MockExchange.sol      # Simple mocks
```

### Step 1: Current State Assessment

**Action**: Analyze existing testing infrastructure and identify improvement opportunities.

**MCP Tool Call**:
```
initialize_protocol_testing_agent(
    analysis_mode="interactive"
)
```

**What This Reveals**:
- Current testing phase (likely "Intermediate" with some basic tests)
- Coverage gaps in existing test suite
- Quality issues with current tests
- Security testing gaps

**Followed by**:
```
analyze_project_context(
    include_ai_failure_detection=true,
    generate_improvement_plan=true
)
```

**Deep Analysis Results**:
- **Testing Maturity**: "Intermediate" - 23 tests, ~65% coverage, some mocks
- **AI Failure Detection**: May identify issues like:
  - Mocks that always return success
  - Tests that don't validate actual state changes
  - Missing negative test cases
- **Security Assessment**: Identifies missing security scenarios
- **Improvement Plan**: Prioritized list of enhancements

### Step 2: Address Quality Issues First

**Action**: Fix existing test problems before adding new tests.

**Common Issues Found**:

**Mock Cheating Example**:
```solidity
// Problematic mock (always returns true)
contract MockExchange {
    function swap(uint256 amount) external pure returns (bool) {
        return true;  // Never fails!
    }
}
```

**Improved Version**:
```solidity
// Realistic mock with failure scenarios
contract MockExchange {
    mapping(uint256 => bool) public shouldFail;
    
    function swap(uint256 amount) external view returns (bool) {
        if (shouldFail[amount]) revert("Insufficient liquidity");
        return amount > 0;
    }
    
    function setShouldFail(uint256 amount, bool fail) external {
        shouldFail[amount] = fail;
    }
}
```

**Circular Logic Example**:
```solidity
// Problematic test (validates implementation against itself)
function test_balance_calculation() public {
    uint256 balance = protocol.calculateBalance(user);
    assertEq(balance, protocol.calculateBalance(user));  // Circular!
}
```

**Improved Version**:
```solidity
// Test validates expected behavior
function test_balance_calculation() public {
    protocol.deposit(user, 100);
    protocol.addReward(user, 10);
    
    uint256 balance = protocol.calculateBalance(user);
    assertEq(balance, 110);  // Validates expected result
}
```

### Step 3: Systematic Coverage Expansion

**Action**: Execute targeted workflow to enhance existing tests.

**MCP Tool Call**:
```
execute_testing_workflow(
    workflow_type="expand_test_coverage",
    objectives="Achieve 90%+ coverage with security focus for audit preparation",
    scope="comprehensive"
)
```

**Targeted Improvements**:

**Phase 1: Coverage Gap Analysis (Days 1-2)**
- Identify uncovered functions and branches
- Prioritize critical paths and security-sensitive code
- Plan test additions based on risk assessment

**Phase 2: Security Testing Enhancement (Days 3-5)**
- Add access control tests for admin functions
- Implement attack scenario testing
- Add reentrancy and overflow protection tests
- Test emergency pause and recovery mechanisms

**Phase 3: Edge Case and Integration Testing (Days 6-8)**
- Boundary value testing (max/min values, zero amounts)
- Multi-contract interaction scenarios
- Failure mode testing (what happens when external calls fail)
- State transition testing

**Phase 4: Advanced Testing Patterns (Days 9-12)**
- Invariant testing for system properties
- Fuzz testing for edge case discovery
- Fork testing against real protocols (if applicable)
- Gas optimization validation

### Step 4: Add Helper Utilities to Existing Tests

**Action**: Refactor existing tests to use shared utilities.

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Create `test/utils/TestHelper.sol` using the helper template
2. Gradually refactor existing tests to inherit from TestHelper
3. Extract common patterns into reusable functions
4. Maintain backward compatibility during transition

**Before Refactoring**:
```solidity
contract TokenTest is Test {
    function setUp() public {
        vm.deal(address(0x1), 10 ether);
        vm.deal(address(0x2), 10 ether);
        token = new Token();
        // Repeated setup code...
    }
}
```

**After Refactoring**:
```solidity
contract TokenTest is Test, TestHelper {
    function setUp() public {
        setupAccounts();     // From TestHelper
        token = new Token();
        setupTokenBalances(token, 1000);  // From TestHelper
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Security Testing Focus

**Action**: Add comprehensive security testing for production readiness.

**Security Test Categories**:

**Access Control Testing**:
```solidity
function test_adminFunctions_revertForNonAdmin() public {
    vm.prank(user);
    vm.expectRevert("Unauthorized");
    protocol.emergencyPause();
}
```

**Reentrancy Protection**:
```solidity
function test_withdraw_protectedFromReentrancy() public {
    ReentrantAttacker attacker = new ReentrantAttacker(protocol);
    vm.expectRevert("ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    attacker.attack();
}
```

**Economic Attack Scenarios**:
```solidity
function test_flashLoanAttack_mitigated() public {
    // Simulate flash loan attack scenario
    // Verify protocol defenses work correctly
}
```

### Step 6: Validation and Quality Assurance

**Action**: Validate improvements achieve production readiness.

**Final Validation Checklist**:

**Coverage Validation**:
```
analyze_current_test_coverage(target_coverage=90)
```
- Achieve 90%+ line coverage
- 85%+ branch coverage
- 95%+ function coverage

**Quality Validation**:
```
analyze_project_context(include_ai_failure_detection=true)
```
- Zero AI failure patterns detected
- All critical security scenarios covered
- Realistic mock implementations

**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for comprehensive improvements

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

### Test Organization

**Recommended Directory Structure**:
```
test/
├── unit/
│   ├── TokenTest.sol
│   ├── VaultTest.sol
│   └── GovernanceTest.sol
├── integration/
│   ├── TokenVaultIntegrationTest.sol
│   └── FullWorkflowTest.sol
├── security/
│   ├── AccessControlTest.sol
│   ├── ReentrancyTest.sol
│   └── AttackScenarioTest.sol
├── invariant/
│   ├── TokenInvariantTest.sol
│   └── VaultInvariantTest.sol
├── utils/
│   ├── TestHelper.sol
│   └── Mocks.sol
└── fork/
    └── MainnetIntegrationTest.sol
```

### Naming Conventions

**Test Function Naming**:
```solidity
function test_functionName_whenCondition_shouldResult() public {
    // Implementation
}

// Examples:
function test_transfer_whenInsufficientBalance_shouldRevert() public
function test_deposit_whenValidAmount_shouldUpdateBalance() public
function test_withdraw_whenPaused_shouldRevert() public
```

### Template Usage Patterns

**For Each Contract, Create**:
1. **Unit Test File**: Test individual functions in isolation
2. **Integration Test File**: Test interactions with other contracts
3. **Security Test File**: Test access control and attack scenarios
4. **Invariant Test File**: Test system-wide properties (for core contracts)

**Template Customization Process**:
1. Access appropriate template from `testing://templates/{type}`
2. Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values with your specific details
3. Add contract-specific test scenarios
4. Follow usage instructions provided with each template

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Coverage Analysis Problems

**Symptom**: `analyze_current_test_coverage` fails or returns incorrect results

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `forge coverage` works manually: `forge coverage --report summary`
2. Check project compilation: `forge build`
3. Ensure tests pass: `forge test`
4. Use `validate_current_directory()` to check project setup

### Directory Detection Issues

**Symptom**: Tools report wrong directory or can't find contracts

**Solutions**:
1. Run `debug_directory_detection()` for detailed diagnosis
2. Ensure you're in the project root directory (where foundry.toml exists)
3. Configure MCP client working directory if needed
4. Set `MCP_CLIENT_CWD` environment variable if required

### Tool Routing Problems

**Symptom**: MCP tools not found or not responding

**Solutions**:
1. Check MCP client configuration
2. Verify server is running properly
3. Review server logs for errors
4. Restart MCP client and server if needed

### Test Quality Issues

**Symptom**: High coverage but tests aren't catching bugs

**Solutions**:
1. Run `analyze_project_context` with AI failure detection
2. Review identified quality issues
3. Focus on realistic failure scenarios
4. Ensure tests validate actual state changes, not just execution
